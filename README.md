# Web-Traffic-Analysis

## Summary
* Analysed Google Analytics data to identify the key drivers behind decreasing web traffic and its impact on sales for a client.
* Recommended focusing marketing efforts on primary traffic source and valuable customer segments. Developed a cross-selling engine in R to increase average transaction value.


## Methodology
* This was a real-life consulting project, a group work which we met up with the CEO and staff to understand how their business operates and the exisiting challenges they were facing. After a series of research and analysis using data on Google Analytics which we were authorised access to, we discovered that there was a decreasing trend of web traffic and conversion and hence decided that it would be an insightful scope to look into their ecommerce platform.
* From there, we tried to make sense of the data, understand the reasons behind declining web traffic and ecommerce sales to provide some suggestions of improvement. Research on other market competitors that has an ecommerce page was also taken into consideration before recommendations were formulated.
* The parts which I was mainly in charge of is highlighted below.

Fromt this chart, we can see that the channels that brought the most users are:
  * Social
    * The social media platforms that they have been using has been effective in bringing potential customers to the website.
  * Direct
    * This is pretty concerning as direct channel usually refers to unknown sources, implying that data might not have been complete.
  * Paid Search
    * This could suggest that the keywords bidded were effective
